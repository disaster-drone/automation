## Description
The creation of the VR environment has been automated with a combination of Python, Bash Scripting, and C++. The automation will export an executable VR environment that can be accessed directly through a VR headset like Quest 2. The automation part for this project has multiple components to it and can also be run individually to export the 3D model with textures only as well as creating a VR environment from an existing 3D model (*supported format: .fbx*). The following components of the automation are described below:
* Photogrammetry Script: The photogrammetry script turns the images taken from the drone into a 3D model by using Reality Capture. It is a .bat file which opens reality capture, aligns images, calculates a model, simplifies the model, calculates the texture, and exports the camera location, the .fbx model, and textures for the .fbx.

* Unreal Package Script
* Launch VR Environment Script

## Migration Notes
* Photogrammetry Script
    * The photogrammetry script may need adjustments. We we're operating under the assumption that the EE team would deliver at least 5 data sets by the end of the semester to work out any problems with our script but none were delivered.
    * The script must be placed inside a folder along with files "exportcsv.xml" which holds csv export settings, "exportFBX.xml" which holds FBX export settings, and a folder named "Images" containing the drone images.
    * ![image](https://github.com/disaster-drone/automation/assets/94029910/6f1c4492-16df-4cc2-a35a-9083533e0b9d) Sets the coordinate system. This may need to be updated to whichever coordinate system the dataset was taken in.
    * ![image](https://github.com/disaster-drone/automation/assets/94029910/3cb0662b-d0ed-479d-91e2-47e7d3cfd1c0) Currently, the model is being simplified to 250,000 triangles. If you are looking for more detail, set it higher. Keep in mind this may affect performance within the VR Environment,
